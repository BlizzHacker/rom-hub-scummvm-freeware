# ScummVM freeware plugin for ROM Hub

Implements the RPP v1 `search` and `importer` capabilities against
`https://downloads.scummvm.org/frs/extras/` — twelve complete adventure games
the ScummVM project distributes free, because their rights holders said so.

| Capability | Endpoint | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `search` | `/frs/extras/<game>/` | matches a table of twelve games, then lists the matching directories |
| `importer` | `/frs/extras/<game>/` | re-reads the listing, then plans the exact archive |

Beneath a Steel Sky. Flight of the Amazon Queen. Lure of the Temptress.
Dráscula. DreamWeb. Sołtys. Sfinx. Mystery House. Nippon Safes, Inc. Broken
Sword 2.5. The Griffon Legend. God of Thunder.

## Why this material is legitimate

**Each of the twelve is free because a named rights holder released it**, and
the plugin carries that sentence per game in `games.py`'s `freed_by` column —
surfaced on every search result, so the claim travels with the game instead of
living only here:

- **Revolution Software** released *Beneath a Steel Sky* and *Lure of the
  Temptress* as freeware in 2003. It holds the rights to both.
- **John Passfield and Steve Stamatiadis**, the authors, released *Flight of
  the Amazon Queen* as freeware in 2004.
- **Neil Dodwell and David Dew** of Creative Reality released *DreamWeb* as
  freeware in 2012.
- **Alcachofa Soft** released *Dráscula*; **L.K. Avalon** released *Sołtys* and
  *Sfinx*; **Dynabyte** released *Nippon Safes, Inc.*
- **Ken and Roberta Williams** placed *Mystery House* in the public domain in
  1987 — the one entry here that is public domain rather than freeware.
- *Broken Sword 2.5* is a free fan-made game distributed by its own authors;
  *The Griffon Legend* and *God of Thunder* were released free by theirs.

None of this is abandonware and none of it is a dump of retail media. What you
download is ScummVM-ready game data the project has hosted for years and links
from its own front page.

## robots.txt, in detail, because it matters here

Two hosts, two different answers, and the plugin uses exactly one of them.

- **`downloads.scummvm.org`** — where this plugin reads and where the archives
  live. `GET /robots.txt` answers **404**: the host publishes no crawl
  directives at all. Verified 2026-07-29.
- **`www.scummvm.org`** — a different host, whose robots.txt does
  `Disallow: /frs` and `Disallow: /downloads` for `User-agent: *`. **This
  plugin never requests anything from it.** It is not in `manifest.toml`'s
  `network` list, so the broker would refuse the request if a future version
  tried.

The list of twelve games in `games.py` was read once, by a human, from
`https://www.scummvm.org/games/` — a path that same robots.txt permits — and
checked in. It is not fetched at runtime. That ordering is the point: a
robots-permitted page was read to build a static table, and the runtime
traffic goes only to the host with no directives at all.

## The directory table is the safety model

`/frs/extras/` is one directory per *title*, and **only some of those titles
are free games.** The rest are add-ons for games still very much on sale:
`Blade Runner/` holds subtitles, `Toonstruck/` holds cutscene subtitles,
`Elvira 2/` holds sound samples, `Broken Sword I and II/` holds a subtitle
pack.

So `games.py` is an **allowlist**, not a convenience. A directory not in it is
unreachable: search never looks at it and the importer refuses a `source_id`
naming it. It is not filtered out after the fact — there is no code path that
can build a URL into it.

Within an allowed directory, checksum sidecars (`*.sha256`) and manuals
(`dreamweb-manuals-en-highres.zip`) are excluded by name. Language and audio
add-ons (`drascula-audio-flac-2.0.zip`, `lang_he.b25c`) are **kept**: unlike a
manual they are part of playing the game, and an operator who asks for the FLAC
audio pack knows what they asked for.

## Search

    rom-hub search scummvm-freeware "steel sky"
    rom-hub search scummvm-freeware drascula

Matching is done **in memory** against the twelve titles and slugs, so a query
nobody's title contains costs zero requests and a one-word query typically
costs one. Only the games that matched have their directory listed.

One result per *file*, not per game: Dráscula is six archives and DreamWeb is
seven language editions, and collapsing those would mean the plugin picking a
language for you. The filename is in the title so the choice is visible.

## Importing

    rom-hub import scummvm-freeware "soltys/soltys-en-v1.0.zip"

The importer re-reads the directory and requires an **exact** filename match.
ScummVM re-releases these archives — `drascula-int-1.0.zip` became
`drascula-int-1.1.zip` — so a name from an older search can be gone, and the
refusal lists what the directory offers now.

Everything lands in the `ScummVM freeware` RomM collection by default.

## Platform

All twelve are filed under RomM's `scummvm` platform, which is what they are:
ScummVM-ready game data, not dumps of the original floppies or CDs. The slug is
stated **per row** rather than as one module constant, so a row added later for
a DOS-only or Amiga-only freeware drop can say so without anyone having to
notice that a shared default stopped being true. `--platform` overrides.

## Install

    rom-hub plugin install https://github.com/BlizzHacker/rom-hub-scummvm-freeware --ref v0.1.0

## Config

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_games` | `int` | `6` | Hard bound on directory listings per search (capped at 12) |
| `collection` | `str` | `ScummVM freeware` | RomM collection imports are filed under |

## Notes for the next person

- **The filenames are read, the directories are not.** Holding a table of
  filenames as well would mean every ScummVM re-release silently stops
  importing. Reading the listing picks up a new build with no code change,
  while the directory allowlist still decides what may be looked at.
- **Dráscula's directory has a trailing underscore** —
  `Drascula_ The Vampire Strikes Back` — where the title has a colon. The
  server does not redirect a near miss; it 404s.
- **The size column is Apache's rounded `3.3M`.** It is carried as
  `extra.size_text` and never as `size_bytes`, so nothing downstream verifies
  a download against a rounded number.
- A document that is not a `/frs/extras` index **raises** rather than parsing
  to no rows, so a maintenance page cannot read as an empty game directory.
