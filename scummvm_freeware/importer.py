"""Turn one `<game slug>/<filename>` into a FetchPlan.

The whole of the safety argument is one line: **the slug is resolved
through `games.py` before anything else happens.** A `source_id` naming a
directory that is not one of the twelve cannot produce a URL, so the
subtitle packs and cutscene archives that sit beside these games under
`/frs/extras/` are unreachable from here -- not filtered out afterwards,
unreachable.

After that:

* **The listing is re-read and the filename must match exactly.** ScummVM
  re-releases these archives (`drascula-int-1.0.zip` became
  `drascula-int-1.1.zip`), so a name from an older search can be gone.
  A near miss is a different build, not a close one.
* **A manual or a checksum sidecar is refused by name**, even when it is
  really in the directory, because `is_payload` is the same rule search
  applied and an operator who typed the name by hand should get the same
  answer as one who clicked a result.
* **The platform comes from the table.** Every row states its own, so a
  row added later for a DOS-only freeware drop says so rather than
  inheriting a default nobody re-checked.
